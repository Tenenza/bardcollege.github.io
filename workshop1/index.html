    <h2>ELIZA:  A Computer Program For the Study of Natural Language Communication Between Man
      And Machine (1966)</h2>
    
    <blockquote>      
      "It is said that to explain is to explain away. This maxim is
      nowhere so well fulfilled as in the area of computer
      programming, especially in what is ealled heuristic programming
      and artificial intelligence. For in those realms machines are
      made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even
      the most experienced observer. But once a particular program is
      unmasked, once its inner workings are explained in language
      sufficiently plain to induce understanding, its magic crumbles
      away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures,
      each quite comprehensible. The observer says to himself "I could
      have written that". With that thought he moves the program in
      question from the shelf marked "intelligent", to that reserved
      for curios, fit to be discussed only with people less
      enlightened than he. <br><br>
      
      The object of this paper is to cause just such a reevaluation of
      the program about to be "explained". Few programs ever needed it
      more." <br><br>
